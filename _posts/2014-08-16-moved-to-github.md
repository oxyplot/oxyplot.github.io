title: The project has moved to GitHub
---

OxyPlot has moved from [CodePlex] to [GitHub]. The main reasons for the move is the nice and modern user interface of GitHub, [Github pages] and a hope of getting more people to collaborate on the project.

All open issues have been migrated to the GitHub [issue tracker] and tagged with 'CodePlex'. 

All discussion threads have been migrated to [discussion.oxyplot.org][forum] which is hosted by [UserEcho][userecho]. Each topic has been tagged with 'CodePlex'. The migration process was done by a [small tool][migration-tools].

The [website][website] and [documentation][/docs] pages are now built by [Jekyll][jk] and hosted with [GitHub pages][pages]. There is even an [announcements feed][feed]! The content can be edited in the [oxyplot.github.io repository][ghp].
